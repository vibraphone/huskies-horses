HOPE for HORSES and HUSKIES is a local non-profit organization located in the
La Madera area just west of SPCE on Stagecoach Rd.  This registered 501c3
non-profit rescues and re-homes a significant number of Siberian Huskies,
and other related canines in addition to saving horses that are in jeopardy
of abandonment or euthanasia.  They annually place approximately 10 to 15
huskies annually to new “forever homes” in the East Mountain area.

Cheryl and Terri host a husky pack that varies from about 30 to 40 huskies.
The number fluctuates as they are able to place dogs in loving forever homes.
The pack has a daily howl session and enjoys roaming on the fenced 15 acres
of New Mexico mountain terrain.
