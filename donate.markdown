This non-profit is run by Cheryl and Terri Fleming.  If you enjoy the work we do, please consider donating to support feeding and caring for all of the animals! It's a huge job taking care of roughly 40 Huskies and 3 horses every day.  Cheryl recently stated that:

>With all of the day-to-day (and night-to-night) care for these dogs and horses, it has been almost impossible for me to do anything else.

When not directly caring for the foundation animals, Cheryl and Terri also spend time searching the local animal pounds for huskies and working to rescue those that fit their non-profits mission, and advertising available huskies for adoption.  Sometimes they even take on other animals (like a wolf and some wolf-dogs) to prevent them from being euthanized at regional animal pounds. Frequently, they make trips to pounds, retrieving donations of food, supplies, and money, shopping and returning with dog food, medications, and alfalfa as well as raising money to support the non-profit. 

Please send checks or money orders (made out to &ldquo;Hope for Horses&rdquo;) to:

Thank you in advance for your generous support!
