## Cheryl's sad story about Foxy, but with a happy ending

>Poor little Foxy was one of our top sad cases. She was found almost dead in a border town between Texas and Mexico. Someone had severely abused her, starved her, and drug her behind a vehicle by her collar. Then left her in the heat to die. I still get tears recalling her story. 
>
> She was emaciated, full of ticks, and had road rash scabs on her little legs. Thr ticks gave her a tick-borne disease. It is a miracle she lived and got to our rescue mission. I saw a little post about someone needing to take Foxy in. It said she was already a senior dog. I knew it was talking to me. Due to some generous and loving  people, she was brought here. It took a year to bring her health back. 
>
> Foxy has been here over 3 years now, and is one of those cases where the dog will never leave here. She sleeps by my side of the bed every night, and knows she is loved!
