## Cheryl's story about Ace

>Ace was in constant pain from a genetic deformity that caused his eyelashes to turn in towards his eyes. This eventually causes blindness after years of suffering. And even in blindness, the dog still suffers.

I recognized this when I first saw Ace in a hopeless state in the notorious Valencia County dog pound. It is a high kill shelter. Ace wasn't going to make it out of there. So, as soon as I saw him, I said I'd take him. 

I got Ace neutered, and got surgery on one eye, and then the next. Now. as you can see in the photo, he is comfortable and happy and living the life of a Husky revelling in being a regular member of a Husky pack.
